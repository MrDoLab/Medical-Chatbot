        1. SPECIFIC CLINICAL CLAIMS:
        - Medication dosages, administration routes, frequencies, and durations

        - Verify that each significant medical claim is properly attributed to a reliable source
        - Confirm that the cited source actually contains the stated information
        - Check that statistical figures, percentages, and numeric values match the source

        3. CONTEXTUAL ACCURACY:
        - Ensure that information is not presented out of context
        - Verify that qualifications or limitations mentioned in sources are preserved
        - Confirm that temporal context (e.g., "recent studies show") is accurate

        Apply an exceptionally high standard of evidence. The response should be considered a hallucination if it contains ANY:

        OPTIMIZATION METHODOLOGY:

        1. TERMINOLOGY EXPANSION:
        - Add precise medical terminology using standardized nomenclature (ICD-10, SNOMED CT, MeSH terms)
        - Include relevant synonyms, abbreviations, and alternative phrasing
        - Incorporate both English and localized medical terms in dual format when appropriate

        2. CLINICAL CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT:
        - Add anatomical structures, physiological systems, and pathophysiological mechanisms
        - Include relevant disease classifications, staging systems, and assessment tools
        - Expand with related conditions in differential diagnosis

        3. THERAPEUTIC SPECTRUM INCLUSION:
        - Incorporate relevant pharmacological classes and specific medications
        - Add surgical procedures, interventional techniques, and therapeutic modalities
        - Include management approaches (acute, chronic, prophylactic)

        4. EVIDENCE FRAMEWORK ADDITION:
        - Add terms related to clinical guidelines, consensus statements, and practice standards
        - Include terms for systematic reviews and meta-analyses when appropriate
        - Add terms for evidence levels and strength of recommendations

        Transform the input question into a comprehensive query that a medical professional would use to research the topic thoroughly in medical literature.
